# Workflow Conventions

Project-specific conventions that guide how superpowers plugin skills behave in this project.

## Planning

- Plans MUST be written to `docs/product/plans/<prefix>-plan.md`
  - `<prefix>` is the ticket number (e.g., `BIK-12`) or sprint number (e.g., `sprint-3`)
  - Ask the user which prefix to use if unclear
- If a plan exists in `.claude/plans/` but not in `docs/product/plans/`, persist it using `/persist-plan`
- Plans should include:
  - Measurable outcomes (concrete yes/no statements)
  - Key workflows (mermaid flowcharts)
  - Alternatives evaluation (table: Effort, Risk, Usability, Impact) — propose 2-3 fundamentally different approaches, not variations
  - System design with component diagram (mermaid) and interfaces table
  - Execution strategy: chunking, sequencing vs parallelism, risk notes
  - Testing & deployment strategy

## Implementation

- Read relevant existing files before writing anything
- Write tests alongside code, not after
- Coverage target: ~80% of new code
- Test all key interfaces, nontrivial logic, and data transformations
- Do NOT test: simple pass-throughs, configuration/constants, third-party library behavior
- Run ALL tests (new + existing) before requesting user help
- Stay focused on the plan — do not refactor unrelated code
- If stuck, say so — don't brute-force

## Code Review

- After tests pass, run a code review before presenting results to the user
- Fix issues found by the reviewer before handoff

## Diagrams

- Use mermaid for all diagrams (architecture, workflows, dependencies)
